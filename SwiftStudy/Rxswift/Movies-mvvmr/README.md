# Movies

Simple app that lists movies on a table view using MVVMR architecture.

## Architecture

```MVVMR = MVVM + Redux + VIPER-Router```

- Mainly uses the structure from MVVM.
- Uses principles from Redux for communication between view model and view controller.
- Introduces a component responsible for routing, similar to VIPER.
- Aims to keep everything simple, but modular and reusable.
